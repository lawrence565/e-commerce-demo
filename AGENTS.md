# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/`: React + TypeScript source code (routes, components, state, API clients).
- `public/`: static assets served as-is (icons, images, `Cover.png`).
- `tests/`: Playwright end-to-end specs.
- `tests-examples/`: reference/spec templates (not run by default).
- `dist/`: production build output (generated by Vite).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run dev`: start the Vite dev server on `http://localhost:5173`.
- `npm run build`: typecheck (`tsc -b`) and produce a production build in `dist/`.
- `npm run preview`: serve the production build locally.
- `npm run lint`: run ESLint across `ts/tsx` sources.
- `npx playwright test`: run end-to-end tests in `tests/`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Indentation: 2 spaces; TypeScript + React (TSX) throughout.
- Prefer functional components and hooks; hooks should be named `useX`.
- Components/TSX files use `PascalCase` (e.g., `ProductCard.tsx`).
- Use the `@/` alias for `src/` imports (configured in `vite.config.ts`).
- Styling uses Tailwind CSS; keep utility class order consistent within a component.
- Linting is enforced by ESLint (`npm run lint`).

## Testing Guidelines
- Framework: Playwright (`tests/`), browser coverage defined in `playwright.config.ts`.
- Naming: `*.spec.ts` and descriptive test titles (e.g., `System Health Verification`).
- If adding UI flows, include coverage for critical pages (home, product, checkout).

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages generally follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`), sometimes with capitalization or Chinese descriptions—keep them concise and imperative.
- PRs should include: a short summary, testing notes (commands + results), and screenshots for UI changes.
- Link relevant issues or tracking docs when applicable.

## Configuration Tips
- Frontend uses Vite + PWA (`vite.config.ts`); update `VITE_BASE_URL` for deployment paths.
- `tailwind.config.js` is the source of custom tokens (e.g., `midBrown`).
